				<p id="#aboutContent">
					I spent almost 20 years of my life growing up in Calgary, Alberta. I
					eventually got sick of the snow and the cold and moved to Seattle,
					unfortunately I forgot that I go to school at BYUi (Brigham Young
					University) which is located in Rexburg Idaho. It's basically just as
					cold and snowy as Calgary... <br /><br />

					I'm currently going to school for a Bachelors in Computer Science, and I'm
					in my sophomore year. I enjoy programming, but don't expect me to get much
					done. (I like to pretend my laziness is a result of an innate desire to
					learn, so I'd prefer to spend my personal time watching informative
					television like Parks and Rec) If not evident in my choice of major I'm a
					huge nerd. If I'm not doing (being?) any of the above I like to play
					guitar and pretend that I can sing. Fortunately for me, and maybe
					unfortunate for you, I can't give any live demos. (Nor will I if you 
					happen to ask) <br /><br />

					Apparently I don't like having my picture taken, because shockingly I have
					zero pictures of me that would be appropriate for an about page like this.
					(I'm working on it!) So until something better comes along you're going to
					have to deal with this photo taken with a bad camera under bad lighting. 
					(I'm the second from the left doing something weird with my neck)
